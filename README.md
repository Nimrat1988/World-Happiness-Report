# World-Happiness-Report

Executive Summary

This project analyzes global happiness data from 2005 to 2023 to understand how happiness varies across countries and to identify the key factors associated with higher life satisfaction. Using exploratory analysis, linear regression, and cluster analysis, the study finds that economic stability and social support together are strongly linked to higher happiness levels. While income plays an important role, social factors significantly influence how happy people feel across different regions of the world.
